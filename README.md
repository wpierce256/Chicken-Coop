# Chicken-Coop

This is our practice repository for Arduino code that we use for learning.  The typical use for our code is to 
control and monitor temperature in Al's chicken coop.  Beyond the learning aspect, we hope to add feed and watering algorithms to 
control mechanical feed and water "robotics".

Info on each file

Oct_12-16_Relay_Control.ino simply tests that you have all the connections correct.  It will cycle the relays on then off 10 times.  If you've wired it up correctly, you'll hear the click of the relays and the lights will blink.

Oct_17-16_Keyboard_Relay_Control.ino  This one does more work as it will respond to a keyboard entry to turn on or off a particular relay.
